This project focuses on the concept of stress and strain in a wrench, explaining howmechanical forces act on the tool when it is used to tighten or loosen a bolt. A wrench experiences stress when an external force or torque is applied, especially near the handle and the jaws where maximum force concentration occurs; this stress depends on the applied load and the cross-sectional area of the wrench material. As the force increases, the wrench undergoes strain, which refers to the small deformation or change in shape it experiences due to the applied load. Although most wrenches are designed from strong materials such as hardened steel to minimize deformation, excessive force may still cause bending, stretching, or even permanent damage if the stress exceeds the material’s elastic limit. Understanding stress and strain behavior in a wrench is important in mechanical engineering and material science because it helps determine safe working loads, improves tool design, and ensures user safety by preventing tool failure. This topic also demonstrates fundamental engineering principles such as Hooke’s Law, elasticity, plastic deformation, material strength, and the relationship between applied torque and resulting mechanical response, making it highly relevant for academic study, laboratory work, and real-world industrial applications
