# Stresses-and-Strain-in-a-wrench
Stress and strain in a wrench describe how the tool reacts when force or torque is applied to tighten or loosen a bolt. Stress refers to the internal force within the wrench material, while strain is the resulting deformation, showing how much the wrench bends or stretches under load.
